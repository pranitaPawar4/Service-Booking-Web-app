//what is mongoose.Types.ObjectId
// mongoose.Types.ObjectId is a "mongoose object" 
// the admin type is an id of object admin
//ref just tells mongoose that you want to store there a reference to another model and at some point you want to populate those and get the full blown model by that reference. In a sense it is nothing more than a foreign key to another collection by which you fetch the actual document when populate is called.
